Hello, my name is Giovani Fouz and I use modern JavaScript
frameworks such as React or Vue to create single page application
or full static sites so that among my skills are HTML, CSS, SCSS,
JavaScript and TypeScript. Besides i feel very comfortable with
some react technologies as styled-components, Material UI,
react-query, react-hook-form and NextJs and very soon i will be
learning about Deno that is a new technology on the server side.
